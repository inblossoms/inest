# inest

This project will eventually implement the vast majority of the functions in the overview of the NestJs official website to help understand and learn the working mechanism of NestJs.

_Before learning this project, I mind getting to know the preview content in the tutorial first. If you already have the basic knowledge of Ts decorators and Reflect-metadata, you can directly start reading the project content._

## Project Structure

1. **@inest/common:** provides the basic components and tools of the framework
2. **@inest/core:** takes care of the overall architecture of the application and the request handling process.
3. **@inest/shared:** contains the shared code between the core and the application.

You can refer to the overview on the official website or conduct the test through the files provided under the apps directory. ðŸ¥³
